    <h1><head><p style="text-align:center; font-size: 50px;">Hello I am casper and heres a spooky story about the haunted house I live in. </p></head></h1>
    <h2>
        <p style="text-align:center; font-size: 20px;">
     In a small, forgotten town, there stood an old, creaky house that everyone avoided,
     claiming it was haunted by Casper, the friendliest ghost. 
     Each night, when the moon cast eerie shadows, the house would whisper secrets of its past. 
     Legend had it that Casper, once a cheerful boy, had vanished on a stormy night, his laughter echoing through the halls.
     Now, he roamed the empty rooms, playfully rearranging furniture and leaving glowing footprints in the dust.
     Those brave enough to venture close would often hear his soft giggles, but if they lingered too long,
    the doors would slam shut, trapping them in a friendly but chilling game.
     Only by solving the mystery of his disappearance could they escape his playful haunt.</p></h2>
